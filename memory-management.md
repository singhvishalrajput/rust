Memory Management in Programming

Garbage Collector

Managed automatically by the language.

No manual control over memory.

Rarely causes dangling pointers or memory leaks.

Examples: Java, JavaScript

🔹 Manual Management

Developer allocates and frees memory manually.

Can easily lead to memory leaks or dangling pointers.

High learning curve.

Example: C

🔹 The Rust Way

Rust uses an ownership model for memory management.

Ensures memory safety without a garbage collector.

Prevents common memory errors at compile time.

Rust’s approach combines performance of C with safety of high-level languages.
